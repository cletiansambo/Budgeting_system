## PROJECT OVERVIEW: 
This project is a web-based personal budgeting tool designed to help users manage their income more effectively. It guides users through entering their income, allocating it into categories such as needs, wants, and savings—using popular budgeting rules like the 50/30/20 model,the user can also customize the model to a 60/20/20 model or a 70/30/10 model—and then visualizes the breakdown with an easy-to-understand pie chart.

The goal is to make budgeting simple, interactive, and accessible for anyone, especially those with little financial management experience. By providing clear guidance and visual feedback, the app empowers users to build better money habits and take control of their personal finances.
